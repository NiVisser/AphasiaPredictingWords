# Predicting words belonging to pauses using ROBERTA-LARGE LM

This repository was made for predicting words belonging to pauses using ROBERTA-LARGE, a large-scale language model. This repository was made for the fulfilment of the masterâ€™s thesis information science at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen.  The fine-tuned models that are trained on healthy speech can be used on Huggingface. These are available on this page: https://huggingface.co/Middelz2. 

## Acquiring the dataset
Since the entire dataset is too large to be pushed on Github and may contain sensitive personal information, the data can be made available on request. 

## Installing requirements

This library uses many different libraries. To ensure that all library requirements are met, first create a new virtual environment, locate to the folder and install all requirements using the following command:
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
